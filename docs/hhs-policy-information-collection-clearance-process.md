## 1. Nature of Changes

This HHS Policy for the Information Collection Clearance Process (hereafter *Policy*) is the first issuance to establish the requirements for organizational Information Collection Request (ICR) clearance process and procedures throughout the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This *Policy* does not supersede any other applicable law, higher-level agency directive, or policy guidance.

## 2. Purpose

This *Policy* establishes the Department's requirements for the HHS ICR clearance process and sets forth the framework to implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, [Public Law (Pub. L.) 104-13](https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/244/text), in accordance with [Title 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1320](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320), Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public. According to the [Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance](https://pra.digital.gov/do-i-need-clearance/), the PRA must be adhered to when collecting information from individual people (including federal contractors), business and associations, state, local and tribal governments, and foreign governments, and individual people. In general, the PRA applies even when information is collected from non-US citizens, residences, or businesses as those entities are considered "persons" under the Act. PRA clearance is not needed if it satisfies specific exceptions, including: collecting information from federal employees or military personnel as part of their work duties; requesting from fewer than 10 people; requesting non-standardized questions done in connection with direct observations; or providing discussion time or questions at online or in-person public hearings or meetings.

This *Policy* provides guidance to Operating Divisions (OpDivs) and Staff Divisions (StaffDivs) to assist staff in determining if an information collection requires clearance under the PRA. This *Policy* defines the roles and responsibilities of HHS staff for purposes of the PRA, provides considerations for public involvement, and details the procedures required to effectively and efficiently obtain OMB approval to collect the information. All OpDivs and StaffDiv program offices planning to initiate an ICR must adhere to the requirements and procedures in this *Policy*, unless there is an exception in place, such as section 2035 of the 21st Century Cures Act which exempts the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from PRA requirements for voluntary collections of information during the conduct of research.

## 3. Background

The PRA governs how federal agencies collect information from the American public. On August 29, 1995, OMB published a rule, "Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public; Regulatory Changes Reflecting Recodification of the Paperwork Reduction Act," ([Title 5, Chapter II, Subchapter B, Part 1320](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320)) that implements the provisions of the PRA. Each federal agency must ensure the quality and accuracy of the information it collects and that it is used for its intended purpose while also minimizing the associated burden imposed on the American public. Before a federal agency imposes an applicable information collection upon the public, an ICR must be sent to and approved by OMB before the information collection begins. Each agency's information collection, and the annual response hours and cost burden incurred by the public, are tracked in the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC)/ Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Combined Information System (ROCIS).

The PRA requires federal agencies to:

- Designate a senior official who reports to the agency head.
- Establish an office responsible for ensuring compliance with and effective implementation of the information policies and information resources management responsibilities under the PRA, including the reduction of information collection burdens on the public.
- Establish a process within that office sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed information collections should be approved.
- Submit and publish notices in the Federal Register and to OIRA, within OMB, to describe proposed information collections and solicit comments from the public.
- Receive approval from OIRA before commencing the proposed information collection.
- Report to OIRA information collections conducted in violation of the PRA's provisions and progress of initiatives to reduce information collection burden.

The intent of the PRA is, in part, to:

- Minimize the paperwork burden the federal government imposes on individuals, businesses, educational and nonprofit institutions, federal contractors, and state, local and tribal governments resulting from the collection of information by or for the federal government, especially by utilizing modern technology.
- Ensure the greatest possible public benefit from and maximize the utility of information created, collected, maintained, used, shared, and disseminated by or for the federal government.
- Ensure that an information collection is not unnecessarily duplicative of information otherwise reasonably accessible.
- Maximize the cooperation of agencies in making information available.
- Improve the quality and use of federal information to strengthen decision making, accountability, and openness in government and society.
- Improve the quality of information collected and subsequently the integrity, quality, and utility of the federal statistical system.
- Minimize the cost to the federal government of the creation, collection, maintenance, use, dissemination, and disposition of information.

## 4. Scope

This *Policy* applies to all HHS OpDivs, StaffDivs, and organizations conducting business for and on behalf of the Department through contractual relationships, cooperative agreements, and certain grants. This *Policy* does not supersede any other applicable law or higher-level agency directive or policy guidance. All staff conducting or overseeing information collections on behalf of the federal government are subject to this *Policy*. OpDivs and StaffDivs must comply with this *Policy* or create a more restrictive policy, but not one that is less restrictive, less comprehensive, or less compliant with these Department policy requirements.

## 6. Policy

HHS has established a centralized function for managing its information collection program and ensuring compliance with the PRA. The HHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Office of Enterprise Services (OES) houses the HHS Information Collection Clearance Office (ICCO) that serves as the Department's PRA management office and liaison with OMB/OIRA. This office is independent of and separate from program operations that may be sources of ICRs to ensure that decision-making processes do not suffer from conflicts of interest. This office consists of one or more ICCOs that serve as the single focal point for managing the Department's PRA program, including the submission of ICRs to OMB.

All OpDivs are required to have a designated Information Collection Clearance Officer to serve as a single point of contact within the OpDiv on PRA matters. The OpDiv ICCO works with ICR requestors to ensure timely preparation and submission of ICRs to the HHS ICCO. All ICRs and required clearances must be processed through the HHS ICCO as the only official channel for conducting ICRs with OMB on behalf of HHS. Each OpDiv's ICCO works closely with the HHS ICCO to coordinate OpDiv PRA activities and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, policies, and guidance.

For a more detailed overview of the Information Collection Clearance process please see Appendix A. For additional questions, please contact the HHS ICCO at [PRA@hhs.gov](mailto:PRA@hhs.gov).

### A.1 High-Level Overview of the Information Collection Clearance Process

A high-level overview of the ICR clearance process is illustrated in the process diagram below (see Figure 1). The process diagram lists questions to determine whether PRA applies, which types of PRA clearance may apply and the different types of approval processes. The diagram is not comprehensive, and it is best to consult with the OpDiv/OS ICCO to determine the most appropriate ICR process.

The ability to answer the following four questions, plays a critical role in determining whether PRA clearance is required: "What type of information are you collecting?"; "Who are you collecting the information from?"; "How will you be collecting information?"; and "Why are you collecting this information?".

### A.2 Do I Need Clearance?

Not every request or collection of information falls under the PRA's scope, and may not need clearance at all (e.g., if information is requested from fewer than ten people or groups that do not represent the majority of an industry or sector). **It is important to note that voluntary collections are not automatically exempt** from the PRA process. Regardless of whether the collection is voluntary (i.e., the public is not required by law to provide information) or mandatory, the Paperwork Reduction Act treats the collection the same.

When deciding if PRA clearance is needed, submitters should consider the following:

- What type of information are you collecting?
- Who are you collecting it from?
- How will you be collecting information?
- Why are you collecting this information?

This is just a starting point to see if the information collection needs PRA clearance. PRA submitters are encouraged to get in touch with their OpDiv ICCO who will coordinate with the HHS ICCO to answer more in-depth questions about the PRA process.

#### A.2.1 What Type of Information Are You Collecting?

The type of information to be collected will help determine if PRA clearance applies. The following sections provide a high-level overview of the types of information collections that require PRA clearance as well as those that do not.

##### A.2.1.1 Needs PRA Clearance

PRA clearance is required when asking for information collected by or on behalf of the federal government ([pra.digital.gov](https://pra.digital.gov/do-i-need-clearance/)). Some examples include:

- Forms, such as the IRS 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return;
- Surveys, such as asking the public about their experiences with a government program;
- Interviews, such as structured questions asked of members of the public;
- Focus groups where the same questions are asked of each group;
- Applications, such as grant applications or permit applications;
- Recordkeeping or reporting requirements, such as asking entities to maintain records for government inspection; and
- Tests or compliance information that individuals or organizations must complete in response to an agency requirement.

##### A.2.1.2 Does Not Need PRA Clearance

Examples of information collections that do not need PRA clearance include:

- Information requested from current federal employees as part of their job;
- Administrative actions, such as investigations, audits, inspections, examinations, tests, or intelligence-gathering;
- General solicitations of comments, such as calls for information published in the Federal Register;
- Collections of information at public hearings or meetings;
- Facts or opinions obtained through direct observations by employees or agents of the sponsoring agency or through non-standardized oral communications in connection with such direct observations; and
- Collections of information involving fewer than ten people during any 12-month period.

### A.3 Types of PRA Clearance

There are different types of PRA clearance that can be requested based on the information collection's characteristics and timeline requirements:

#### A.3.1 Standard Clearance

Standard clearance is the normal PRA approval process and typically takes 6-9 months from development to OMB approval. This process includes:

- 60-day Federal Register notice for public comment
- Consideration of public comments and revisions as needed
- 30-day Federal Register notice concurrent with OMB submission
- OMB review and approval

#### A.3.2 Generic Clearance

Generic clearance allows agencies to collect similar information from the public multiple times over a specified period (typically 3 years) without going through the full PRA process each time. This is useful for:

- Customer satisfaction surveys
- Focus groups or usability testing
- Formative research activities
- Pre-testing of materials

#### A.3.3 Emergency Clearance

Emergency clearance can be requested when normal PRA timelines would:

- Compromise public safety or welfare
- Result in likely public harm (such as delivery of resources after a natural disaster)
- Cause missing of court-ordered or statutory deadlines

**Note:** Internal delays are not emergencies. Components must formally request emergency clearance in accordance with [5 CFR 1320.13](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320/section-1320.13).

### A.4 PRA Approval Processes

#### A.4.1 Plan Ahead for PRA

Most organizations estimate six to nine months for standard PRA clearance from development of the information collection to OIRA's decision. By law, this process, in most cases, includes at least three months of public comment.

The project timeline for PRA varies depending on internal and external processes. The submitter can start the 60-day comment period in the Federal Register and consider public comments while simultaneously developing the more detailed request for OMB review.

#### A.4.2 High-Level Process Overview for Standard Clearance

| Steps | OpDiv/OS | Public | HHS | OMB |
|-------|----------|--------|-----|-----|
| **Step 1** – OpDiv/OS develop the information request | ✓ | | | |
| **Step 2** – OpDiv/OS publish 60-day notice to the Federal Register for comment | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| **Step 3** – OpDiv/OS consider the public comments on the notice, and make changes, if applicable | ✓ | | | |
| **Step 4** – OpDiv/OS publish the 30-day notice to the Federal Register for public comment and concurrently HHS ICCO submits final package to OMB for review | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **Step 5** – OMB reviews the information collection and makes a decision | | | | ✓ |

### A.5 Submitting ICRs to OMB

All ICR submissions to OMB must be made through the HHS ICCO using ROCIS (Regulatory Information Service Center/Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Combined Information System).

### A.6 OMB PRA Approval Process Timeline

The OMB review process typically takes 60 days from the date of submission, though this can vary based on the complexity of the request and OMB's workload.

### A.7 Estimating Burden

Burden estimates must include:

- Time required to complete the information collection
- Number of respondents
- Frequency of response
- Total annual burden hours
- Cost to respondents (when applicable)
